Abstract:
    Determining the intensity of lines and continuum airglow emission in
    the H-band is important for the design of faint-object infrared
    spectrographs. Existing spectra at low/medium resolution cannot
    disentangle the true sky-continuum from instrumental effects (e.g.
    diffuse light in the wings of strong lines).
    We aim to obtain, for the first time, a high resolution infrared
    spectrum deep enough to set significant constraints on the continuum
    emission between the lines in the H-band.
    During the second commissioning run of the GIANO high-resolution
    spectrograph at the La Palma Observatory, we pointed the instrument
    directly to the sky and obtained a deep spectrum that extends from
    0.97 to 2.4 micron and includes the whole H-band. The spectrum shows
    about 1500 emission lines, a factor of two more than in previous
    works. Of these, 80% are identified as OH transitions; half of these
    are from highly excited molecules (hot-OH component).
    The other lines are attributable to O_2_ or unidentified. Several of
    the faint lines are in spectral regions that were previously believed
    to be free of lines emission. The continuum in the H-band is
    marginally detected at a level of about 300photons/m^2^/s/arcsec^2^/um.
    The observed spectrum and the list of observed sky-lines are published
    in electronic format. Our measurements indicate that the sky continuum
    in the H-band could be even darker than previously believed. However,
    the myriad of airglow emission lines severely limits the spectral
    ranges where very low background can be effectively achieved with
    low/medium resolution spectrographs.
    We identify a few spectral bands that could still remain quite dark at
    the resolving power foreseen for VLT-MOONS (R~6,600).

Description:
    Tables 1 and 2 list the wavelengths and relative photon fluxes of the
    OH airglow lines (Table 1) and the wavelengths and relative photon
    fluxes of other airglow lines (Table 2), measured in the Near-Infrared
    with the echelle spectrometer GIANO at the Telescopio Nazionale
    Galileo. The intensities of the lines (flux) are expressed in units of
    photons/m^2^/s, normalised to the intensity of the brightest line (in
    Table1), which is set to 10^4^. The wavelengths are in vacuum and
    expressed in Angstrom. The Wavelengths in Table 1 are computed from
    the most complete and accurate OH molecular parameters available in
    the literature (Bernath & Colin, 2009, J. Mol. Spec., 257, 20). Table
    4 contains the observed spectrum in the Y,J and H photometric bands.
    The wavelengths are in vaccuum and in Angstrom. The spectral flux is
    expressed in units of photons/m^2^/s/Angstrom, please note that the
    flux calibration is uncertain (see the paper for details).
