If we assume throughput of 0.4 in H band and that this is the most challenging channel for saturation limitations,
then we get 98000 photons/sec for a H_Vega = 6 star per 2 A pixel. 

What is the minimum acceptable exposure time? 1.455 sec for MOSFIRE.

What is maximum counts? 56K e- for 1% linearity with MOSFIRE.

Then we need to spread 143K counts down to 56K maximum --> 2.55 spatial pixels = 1.0 arcsec.

But resetting the detector takes as much time as reading it out (verified for bright JWST modes).
We could probably get down the 1.455 sec by reading out part of the detector. But for now let's leave it.

To get 75% observing efficiency, need to do 3 integrations + 1 reset = 4.5 sec min exposures.
Then for H=6 we require 8 pixels ~ 3.0 arcsec diffuser.
